This repository provides an example of using Puppeteer, a Node.js library for automating headless Chrome or Chromium, to scrape data from a website.

Getting Started
To run this example, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from here.

Clone this repository onto your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yatendra121/webpage-to-image/
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd webpage-to-image
npm install
Run the script:
Copy code
node index.js
This will launch a headless instance of Chromium and navigate to the example website. The script will then extract the title and save it to a file called title.txt.

Understanding the Code
The index.js file contains the main code for this example. Here's a brief overview of what it does:

Import the Puppeteer library:
javascript
Copy code
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
Launch a headless instance of Chromium:
javascript
Copy code
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
Open a new page:
javascript
Copy code
const page = await browser.newPage();
Navigate to the example website:
javascript
Copy code
await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
Extract the title of the page:
javascript
Copy code
const title = await page.title();
Save the title to a file:
javascript
Copy code
await fs.promises.writeFile('title.txt', title);
Close the browser:
javascript
Copy code
await browser.close();
